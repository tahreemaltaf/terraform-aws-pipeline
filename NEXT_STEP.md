   - **Description** (optional): "Automated Terraform CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"
   - Keep it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/tahreemaltaf/terraform-aws-pipeline.git

**Copy this URL!**

### Step 3: Tell Me the URL
Just paste the repository URL here, and I'll push all the code for you!
